He holds the record for most three-pointers made in a season (279) and career (2,974), and he is one of only two players to have scored over 100 points in a single game using only three-pointers.\n",
      "2: Impact on the Game: Curry's shooting ability has changed how teams are built and played. He has made it essential for defenses to guard beyond the arc, leading to more spread offenses and less emphasis on traditional post play.\n",
      "3: Consistency: Throughout his career, Curry has been consistently dominant. He has won back-to-back NBA MVP awards (2015 and 2016) and has led the Golden State Warriors to three NBA championships (2015, 2017, and 2018).\n",
      "4: Leadership: Curry is not only a great player but also an excellent leader. He has been a key figure in the Warriors' success and has helped create a winning culture.\n",
      "5: Legacy: With his unique skill set and impact on the game, Stephen Curry's legacy will likely be remembered as one of the greatest players to ever step onto the basketball court.\n",
