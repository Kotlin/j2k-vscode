# Java to Kotlin converter

This is the monorepo for the development of a standalone Java to Kotlin converter. For the VS Code extension, see `extension/`.

Experiments are documented within `experiments/`. This includes some iterations on the prompt, the initial development of the prompt, and an initial attempt to strengthen the prompt using `DSPy`.
