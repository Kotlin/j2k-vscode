# J2K scoring experiments

To run, copy `config.json`, `scoring.py`, `vN_conversion.py` into Spring Petclinic, and set up a `uv` venv, installing the requirements. Then run `scoring.py`.

Results for previous tests run under `deepseek-r1:8b` are in their separate folders, with Java/Kotlin conversion pairs and their scores. A summary can be obtained by running `analytics.py`.
